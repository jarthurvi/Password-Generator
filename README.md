# Password-Generator

In this assignment we are given starter code for a random password generator. It has a generate password button but does not work when pressed. Users are prompted to select password parameters such as ; uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters. They can also select password length but it must be between 8 and 128 characters. After selecting parameters the user then confirms and the random password is generated. 

I had to create some string variables, prompts and conditions. Then I used Math. random to help me pull random values from each string depending on the users' preferences.
